# University of Manchester Dissertation template

A Microsoft Word template for MSc dissertations submitted in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester. 

Checked to be compliant with the 2021 University regulations. Responsibility for meeting any submission requirements remain with the student, even if making use of this template to help.

This is intended for use with MSc dissertation reports, but with minor changes (mainly on the title page) would also be a suitable template for third year projects, and PhD theses (including the first and second year reports, and the final thesis).
